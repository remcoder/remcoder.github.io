At [Q42](http://www.q42.com) we love IoT. So much so that we've created a connected coffee counter, a remote controller for our Phillips Hue office lights and of course connected toilets. Needless to say we were very excited when Google asked us to help them building their [IoT Developer Kit](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/iot/kit/).

## My First IoT

If you've always wanted to try this IoT thing but were overwhelmed by the options in terms of dev boards and cloud hostings, look no further.
Starting with a [Beagle Bone Green Wireless](https://beagleboard.org/green-wireless), a variant of the popular [Beagle Bone Black](https://beagleboard.org/black), you first add some sensors, like an accelerometer or a light sensor, and then you send that sensor data straight up into The Cloud. Once in the cloud, your data can be visualized in real-time on a webpage for example.
Easy duzzit!

So this kit, which has been available to developers worldwide for about a week now, will walk you through connecting the included sensors to the Internets. Which Internets? Well [Google's Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) of course :-)

## What's inside
If that has piqued your interest, here's what you'll find inside the kit:

 - said Beagle Bone Green Wireless
 - 5 sensors: temperature, accelerometer, tilt, light, motion
 - buzzer
 - multi-color LED
 - 96x96 OLED screen
 - button
 - Grove cables
 - a Grove base cape

## Where to get it
You can [buy this puppy here](https://www.seeedstudio.com/item_detail.html?p_id=2684) and don't forget to drop us a note if you've built something with this kit. Happy hacking!
